## Installation
You'll need to install dotNet Framework 5.0 to run it.



## HOW TO USE:
- You download the source code and import it into Rider/Visual Studio
- You have to enter a E-Mail and the Password of an Ubisoft Account in the Method `GetToken` to get an Authentication Token.
- You export the Project and create three files: "names.txt", "failed.txt", "availableNames.txt"

Then you enter the names in names.txt like this:
```bash
name1
name2

```
