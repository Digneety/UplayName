# Installation
You'll need to install dotNet Framework 7.0 or higher to run it.

## Usage

You have to Enter some Ubisoft accounts to the file `logins.txt`. Enter the Names like this:

**Example**
>username:password

**THE ACCOUNT SHOULD NOT HAVE 2FA ENABLED.**
It will throw an error if 2FA is Enabled.

If you want to use the program continuously you have to use proxies.
Put the proxies into the `proxies.txt`.

**Example**:
>http://{ip}:{port}-{username}-{password}

Remove the curly brackets and replace the placeholders with each respective value.

For the names you want to check put them into the file `names.txt`

**Example**:
> Account
> 
> Account
> 
> Account
